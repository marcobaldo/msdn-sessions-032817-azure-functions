# msdn-sessions-032817-azure-functions
This repo contains code I wrote for the March 28, 2017 MSDN Sessions.

Important files:
- **AzFuncDemo** - Azure Functions I pre-made
- **AzFuncDemoPixel** - Sample client I made to demonstrate asynchronous processing (e.g. page analytics 'pixel')
- **FunctionApp1** - Azure Functions written during the talk showing how templates and simple triggers work
